## 📌 Problem Statement

Mass gatherings—including major religious festivals (e.g., Kumbh Mela, Puri Rath Yatra, Tirupati), stadium concerts, and transit corridors—are uniquely vulnerable to crowd crushes and stampedes. Dangerous crowd turbulence develops gradually at narrow chokepoints, gate barricades, and corridor bottlenecks. By the time visual panic is apparent to humans, crowd compression is often fatal.

Exacerbating this, ultra-dense congregations inevitably cause local cellular base stations (eNodeB/gNodeB) to saturate. Mobile towers face severe uplink/downlink congestion, causing standard cellular voice calls, SMS, and internet-based emergency dispatch apps to fail entirely at the moment of crisis.

Most conventional crowd safety apps operate on an unrealistic premise: expecting frightened attendees in a high-density surge to unlock smartphones, open an app, and report incidents. 

**Festival Guardian 2** solves this from the organizer's operational perspective. It is an edge-deployed surveillance and decentralized communication framework: Guardian Nodes are stationed at critical chokepoints and operated by staff/volunteers or integrated directly with existing venue CCTV infrastructure. If cellular infrastructure collapses, safety alerts hop node-to-node across a local peer-to-peer mesh until reaching dispatch commanders.

## 👥 Dual-Persona Architecture

Festival Guardian 2 is engineered around two distinct operational personas designed to bridge ground-level situational awareness with tactical command dispatch:

    end
```

### 1. Field Guardian Node (Volunteer / Staff at Gates)
* **Target Users**: On-ground event volunteers, gate marshals, corridor security personnel stationed at ingress/egress points, turnstiles, and narrow barricaded walkways.
* **On-Device Vision AI**: Executes real-time object detection directly on the device GPU (TensorFlow.js WebGL pipeline) at ~3 FPS with zero cloud round-trips. Privacy is preserved as video frames never leave the device.
* **Local Density & Flow Scoring**: Computes continuous crowd density ($\text{people}/\text{m}^2$) and flow rate differential ($\Delta\text{flow}$), mapping telemetry into a 0–100 calibrated risk index.
* **Fail-Safe Tactile Incident Actions**:
  * **Emergency SOS**: Requires a deliberate 0.8-second hold-to-activate trigger, preventing accidental triggers in packed or jostling environments.
  * **Theft Incident Reporting**: Instant one-tap logging for localized criminal activity.
  * **Volunteer Assistance Request**: Dispatches peer assistance to relieve bottlenecks or provide first aid.
* **Offline Mesh Broadcast**: Emits typed, cryptographically stamped alert packets with Time-to-Live (TTL) hop counters over the local peer mesh, completely bypassing cellular networks.

### 2. Organizer Control Room (Command Center / Dispatch)
* **Target Users**: Event operations directors, police watch commanders, medical triage supervisors, and stadium security officers.
* **Aggregate Multi-Zone Density Map**: Synthesizes real-time telemetry from all distributed Guardian Nodes into an intuitive bird's-eye map. Zones are dynamically color-coded by risk status (🟢 Safe, 🟡 Caution, 🟠 Warning, 🔴 Danger/Critical).
* **Incident Dispatch Queue with Hop Telemetry**: Centralized triage table recording every inbound alert packet. Tracks originating node identifier, precise GPS coordinates, transit latency, and hop count history (`ttlHops` remaining vs. initial), allowing dispatchers to trace alert pathways across dark zones.
* **Live Venue CCTV / RTSP Camera Ingestion**: Integrates stationary stadium and perimeter cameras into the identical vision pipeline, enabling operators to monitor blind spots without requiring dedicated personnel at every post.

## 📹 CCTV / RTSP Ingestion Architecture (Phase 2 Roadmap)

Large-scale venues (cricket stadiums, festival arenas, temple complexes) rarely require purchasing hundreds of dedicated mobile phones for monitoring. Instead, these facilities are already wired with dozens of high-mounted, pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) IP surveillance cameras.

Festival Guardian 2 introduces a zero-hardware-cost ingestion framework that turns existing venue surveillance cameras into autonomous Guardian Nodes:

```mermaid

    subgraph VenueInfra["Existing Venue Infrastructure (Zero New Hardware)"]
        CAM1["Gate 1 IP Camera (RTSP)"]
        CAM2["Corridor B ONVIF Dome"]
        CAM3["North Plaza PTZ Camera"]
    end

    end

        TFPipeline["TensorFlow / NPU Vision Engine"]
        FruinScorer["Fruin LOS F Density Calibration"]
        WebRTCSrv --> ClientStream --> TFPipeline --> FruinScorer
    end

    subgraph ActionMesh["Autonomous Action"]
        FruinScorer -->|"Score >= 85"| AutoAlert["Auto-Generate CROWD_RISK Alert"]
        AutoAlert --> LocalMesh["Inject into Mesh P2P Relay"]
    end

    CAM1 & CAM2 & CAM3 --> RTSPIn
```

### Ingestion Pipeline Details:
1. **Protocol Demuxing & Normalization**:
   * Stadium cameras output standard RTSP (`rtsp://user:pass@192.168.1.x:554/live`) or ONVIF Profile S streams encoded in H.264/H.265.
   * A lightweight local edge gateway (such as a local Docker container running `go2rtc` or a GStreamer pipeline on the venue NVR) ingests multiple RTSP feeds without cloud dependencies.
2. **Sub-200ms WebRTC Delivery**:
   * Traditional streaming formats like HLS or RTMP introduce 3–15 seconds of buffering latency—unacceptable for stampede detection where 10 seconds can dictate life or death.
   * The gateway repackages the video into WebRTC (RTP/SRTP) peer streams, streaming low-latency video feeds directly to the Control Room dashboard or distributed Guardian nodes over local Wi-Fi or LAN backhaul.
3. **Identical Vision AI Pipeline**:
   * Ingested video feeds bind directly to the existing HTML5 `<video>` elements and GPU canvas buffers.
   * The same `person-detector.ts` and `risk-scorer.ts` engines process the CCTV feeds identically to physical phone cameras.
4. **Economic & Operational Value**:
   * **Eliminates Hardware Procurement**: Saves organizers hundreds of thousands of rupees in dedicated mobile phone or tablet leases.
   * **Superior Overhead Vantage**: Fixed ceiling-mounted CCTV streams provide perpendicular wide-angle perspectives with significantly less human occlusion than handheld eye-level phone cameras.

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundations & Crowd Risk Calibration

Festival Guardian 2 replaces arbitrary threshold guesses with models calibrated to **NFPA 101 Life Safety Code** and **Dr. John Fruin's Level of Service (LOS)** pedestrian dynamics:

$$\text{Density} = \frac{\bar{N}_{\text{window}}}{\text{Monitored Area } (m^2)}$$

```
Fruin Level of Service (LOS) Scale:
• LOS A–C (< 1.08 p/m²): Free pedestrian flow, normal walking speeds.
• LOS D–E (1.08 - 2.17 p/m²): Constrained movement, severe bypass difficulty.
• LOS F   (> 3.8 - 4.0 p/m²): Physical contact, shockwave propagation, stampede risk.
```

### Calibration Equation

Our multi-frame risk function suppresses momentary single-frame false alarms while aggressively tracking compression turbulence:

$$\text{Risk Score} = \min\left(100, \; S_{\text{density}} + S_{\text{flow}}\right)$$

Where:
* **Base Density Score**:
  $$S_{\text{density}} = \min\left(80, \; \left(\frac{\text{Density}}{4.0 \text{ p/m}^2}\right) \times 80\right)$$
* **Flow Turbulence Score**:
  $$S_{\text{flow}} = \left(\frac{\Delta \text{flow}}{\text{Max Flow}}\right) \times 20 \times \text{Gating}(\text{Density})$$
* **Density Gating Function**:
  $$\text{Gating}(\text{Density}) = \text{clamp}\left(\frac{\text{Density} - 1.0}{2.5}, \; 0.0, \; 1.0\right)$$

> [!NOTE]
> Flow turbulence ($\Delta \text{flow}$) is only scored when density exceeds $1.0\text{ p/m}^2$. A single person running in an empty hallway does not trigger a false stampede panic; turbulence only poses stampede risk when crowd density reaches elevated thresholds.
